# ALEVELS
As students who have transited from IGCSE to A levels, we tend to sometimes find it difficult due to the uncertainty of what to expect. Us as students have experienced this.

But we wanted to work towards making this issue slightly more dealable (not a word) for future students.

For the last year, we have worked together to produce a website with short notes and summarized videos that can help you with your revision. We aim to update this website on a weekly basis to keep up with new information and better teaching styles.

THIS WEBSITE IS ACCESSIBLE ONLY ON TABLET/IPAD/LAPTOP
